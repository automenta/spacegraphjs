## Vision
SpaceGraph.js aims to be the premier open-source library for interactive 3D graph visualization, enabling users to create, explore, and share complex knowledge graphs with ease. It will offer a delightful user experience through intuitive interactions, visually appealing rendering, and robust customization options. For developers, it will provide a modular, well-documented API that supports rapid prototyping, integration, and extension for diverse applications, from mind mapping to network analysis.

## Goals
1. **Utility**: Support a wide range of use cases, including data visualization, education, and collaborative workflows.
2. **Flexibility**: Allow customization of nodes, edges, layouts, and interactions without modifying core code.
3. **Extensibility**: Enable developers to add new node types, layouts, and plugins seamlessly.
4. **Enjoyability**: Create a fun, responsive, and visually engaging user experience with animations and feedback.
5. **User Ergonomics**: Simplify interactions with intuitive controls, touch support, and accessibility features.
6. **Developer Ergonomics**: Provide a clean API, TypeScript support, and comprehensive documentation.

## Core Enhancements

### 1. Modular Architecture
To improve extensibility and maintainability, we’ll refactor SpaceGraph.js into a plugin-based architecture with clear separation of concerns.

- **Core Module**: Minimal `SpaceGraph` class handling scene management, rendering, and event dispatching.
- **Plugin System**:
  - Plugins register components (nodes, edges, layouts, UI elements) via a `PluginManager`.
  - Example: `registerNodeType('custom', CustomNode)`, `registerLayout('grid', GridLayout)`.
  - Plugins can hook into lifecycle events (e.g., `onNodeAdded`, `onRender`).
- **Event Bus**: Centralized event system for loose coupling (e.g., `spaceGraph.emit('node:select', node)`).
- **Dependency Injection**: Allow plugins to inject custom renderers, cameras, or input handlers.

### 2. TypeScript Integration
- Rewrite the codebase in TypeScript for better developer ergonomics and type safety.
- Provide type definitions for all public APIs, nodes, edges, and plugins.
- Use interfaces for extensibility (e.g., `INode`, `IEdge`, `ILayout`).

### 3. Rendering Pipeline
- **Hybrid Rendering**:
  - Retain WebGL (`THREE.WebGLRenderer`) for 3D meshes and CSS3D (`CSS3DRenderer`) for HTML elements.
  - Add optional WebGPU support via `three.js` WebGPURenderer for future-proofing.
- **Edge Rendering**: Replace `THREE.Line` with `Line2` (from `three-fatline`) for dynamic thickness and better visual quality.
- **Post-Processing**: Add bloom, ambient occlusion, and outline effects via `Postprocessing` for visual polish.
- **Performance**:
  - Implement instanced rendering for large node sets.
  - Use frustum culling and LOD (Level of Detail) for nodes and edges.
  - Optimize CSS3D rendering with transform caching.

### 4. Node System
- **Node Factory**: Centralize node creation with a `NodeFactory` supporting custom types.
  - Example: `spaceGraph.createNode('note', { content: 'Hello', position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 } })`.
- **New Node Types**:
  - **ImageNode**: Display images with zoom and pan controls.
  - **VideoNode**: Embed videos with playback controls.
  - **GroupNode**: Container for subgraphs, collapsible for hierarchical organization.
  - **DataNode**: Visualize tabular data or charts (using Chart.js or D3.js).
- **Node Customization**:
  - Support custom templates for HtmlNode (e.g., React/Vue components).
  - Allow 3D model imports (GLTF) for ShapeNode.
  - Add node properties like opacity, border, and shadow.
- **Node Interactions**:
  - Drag in 3D space (not just XY plane) with depth adjustment via modifier keys.
  - Support multi-select and group dragging.
  - Add pinning/unpinning for layout control.

### 5. Edge System
- **Edge Types**:
  - **CurvedEdge**: Bezier or spline curves for aesthetic connections.
  - **LabeledEdge**: Display text labels along edges.
  - **WeightedEdge**: Visualize weights with varying thickness or color gradients.
- **Constraints**:
  - Add `directed` (one-way force) and `bidirectional` constraints.
  - Support custom constraint functions via plugins.
- **Styling**: Allow gradients, dashed patterns, and arrowheads.
- **Performance**: Use instanced geometry for large edge sets.

### 6. Layout System
- **Multiple Layouts**:
  - **ForceDirectedLayout**: Enhanced with clustering and collision detection.
  - **GridLayout**: Arrange nodes in a 2D/3D grid.
  - **CircularLayout**: Position nodes in a circle or sphere.
  - **HierarchicalLayout**: Tree-like structure for directed acyclic graphs.
- **Layout Transitions**: Smoothly interpolate between layouts using GSAP.
- **Constraints**:
  - Add region constraints (e.g., keep nodes within a bounding box).
  - Support alignment constraints (e.g., align nodes on a plane).
- **Performance**: Parallelize force calculations using Web Workers for large graphs.

### 7. Camera System
- **Camera Modes**:
  - **OrbitCamera**: Rotate around a focal point (like Three.js OrbitControls).
  - **FreeCamera**: FPS-style navigation for exploration.
  - **AutoCamera**: Automatically frame the graph or follow a node.
- **Animations**:
  - Use spring-based animations (via `react-spring` or GSAP) for smoother transitions.
  - Add shake or bounce effects for feedback (e.g., on node creation).
- **View Management**:
  - Save named views (e.g., “Overview”, “Cluster A”).
  - Implement a minimap for large graphs.
- **Accessibility**: Support keyboard-only navigation (e.g., arrow keys for panning).

### 8. User Interface
- **Modern UI Framework**:
  - Integrate React for UI components (context menus, dialogs, edge menus).
  - Use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling.
  - Example: `<ContextMenu items={[{ label: 'Add Node', action: 'add-node' }]} />`.
- **Toolbar**:
  - Add a top/side toolbar for common actions (new node, save, undo).
  - Include layout selector and theme toggle (light/dark mode).
- **Feedback**:
  - Show tooltips for controls and shortcuts.
  - Add subtle animations (e.g., node pulse on creation, edge fade-in).
- **Touch Support**:
  - Implement pinch-to-zoom, two-finger pan, and tap-to-select.
  - Support long-press for context menus.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Add ARIA labels for nodes, edges, and menus.
  - Support screen reader navigation.
  - Enable high-contrast mode.

### 9. Interaction Enhancements
- **Undo/Redo**: Implement a command stack for node/edge operations (e.g., `CommandManager.execute(new AddNodeCommand(node))`).
- **Clipboard**: Support copy/paste for nodes and subgraphs.
- **Search**: Add a search bar to find nodes by label or ID.
- **Collaboration**:
  - Integrate WebSocket for real-time multi-user editing.
  - Show user cursors and selection highlights.
- **Gamification**:
  - Add achievements (e.g., “Created 10 nodes!”).
  - Include sound effects for actions (optional, toggleable).

### 10. Data Management
- **Serialization**:
  - Export/import graphs as JSON, GraphML, or GEXF.
  - Support partial exports (e.g., selected subgraph).
- **Data Binding**:
  - Allow nodes to bind to external data sources (e.g., REST API, CSV).
  - Support live updates for dynamic graphs.
- **Metadata**:
  - Add graph-level metadata (title, author, tags).
  - Support node/edge annotations (e.g., comments, tags).

## Developer Ergonomics

### 1. API Design
- **Fluent API**:
  ```typescript
  spaceGraph
    .addNode({ type: 'note', content: 'Idea' })
    .addEdge({ source: 'node1', target: 'node2', style: { color: '#ff0000' } })
    .setLayout('force-directed')
    .start();
  ```
- **Configuration**:
  ```typescript
  const spaceGraph = new SpaceGraph({
    container: '#graph',
    plugins: [NotePlugin, ShapePlugin, ForceLayoutPlugin],
    theme: 'dark',
    camera: { fov: 70, position: { z: 700 } },
  });
  ```
- **Event Hooks**:
  ```typescript
  spaceGraph.on('node:select', (node) => console.log(`Selected ${node.id}`));
  ```

### 2. Documentation
- Use **TypeDoc** for API documentation.
- Provide interactive examples with **Storybook**.
- Include tutorials for common tasks (e.g., custom node, plugin creation).
- Host a live playground (CodeSandbox or similar).

### 3. Tooling
- **Build System**: Use Vite for fast bundling and HMR.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests with Jest and integration tests with Playwright.
- **Linting/Formatting**: Enforce ESLint and Prettier for consistency.
- **CI/CD**: Automate testing, building, and publishing with GitHub Actions.

### 4. Plugin Ecosystem
- Publish a plugin registry (npm or GitHub).
- Provide templates for common plugins (e.g., `create-spacegraph-plugin`).
- Encourage community contributions with clear guidelines.

## Enjoyability Features
- **Themes**: Support light, dark, and custom themes with CSS variables.
