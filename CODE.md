## Code Guidelines / Conventions

- Complete (fully functional)
- Professional-grade, not explanatory/educational
- Correct (bug-free and logically sound)
- Compact (minimal codebase size)
    - Using space-saving syntax constructs, like ternary/switch/etc..., to minimize lines and tokens
    - Using the latest language version's syntax options to best express code
- Consolidated (avoids unnecessary separation)
- Deduplicated (no redundant logic)
    - Introduce helpful abstractions functions, parameters, and classes to share common code
    - Apply "don't repeat yourself" principles
- Modular (logically organized, supporting abstraction, OOP principles)
- Remove all comments, relying only on self-documenting code
    - Clear naming and structure
- Use the latest version of the language, APIs, and dependencies
