### **Phase 5: Revolutionary UI Concepts**

**Goal:** Push the boundaries of UI design, transforming SpaceGraphJS into a platform for truly spatial, intelligent, and collaborative user experiences.

1.  **True Spatial Computing & ZUI Mastery**

    - **Infinite Canvas with Semantic Zoom:** Implement advanced semantic zooming where the representation of information dynamically transforms based on zoom level (e.g., nodes collapse into summary clusters when zoomed out, new interactive elements appear when zoomed in).
    - **Dimensionality as Information:** Leverage the 3D space to semantically organize and reveal information (e.g., time along Z-axis, categories on distinct planes).
    - **Fluid Transitions & Gestural Interaction:** Ensure all transitions (zoom, pan, node expansion, layout changes) are smooth, predictable, and convey meaning. Explore advanced gestural controls (multi-touch 3D manipulation, VR/AR integration).

2.  **Intelligent & Adaptive Layouts**

    - **User-Intent Driven Layouts:** Develop layouts that adapt dynamically based on user focus, active tasks, or defined areas of interest, optimizing readability and interaction.
    - **Hybrid Layouts:** Enable seamless blending of different layout algorithms within the same continuous 3D space (e.g., radial for one section, linear for another).
    - **Constraint-Based Layouts:** Allow users or the system to define soft and hard spatial constraints for nodes and groups.

3.  **Rich, Contextual & Dynamic Nodes**

    - **"Live" Nodes:** Implement nodes as mini-applications or live data feeds (e.g., real-time tickers, collaborative documents, video conference windows embedded directly).
    - **Adaptive Node Content:** Node content that changes based on context (e.g., proximity, active task, user role).
    - **Micro-Interactions within Nodes:** Enable context-sensitive interactions within individual nodes that do not disrupt the overall graph flow.

4.  **Collaborative & Multi-User Spatial Environments**

    - **Shared Spatial Workspaces:** Allow multiple users to simultaneously navigate, manipulate, and interact with the same 3D graph in real-time, with visual cues for presence and activity.

5.  **Beyond Graph Visualization â€“ A General-Purpose Spatial Canvas**
    - **Programmable Spatial UI:** Provide a powerful API for developers to define custom spatial behaviors, node types, and interaction models, enabling SpaceGraphJS to serve as a platform for entirely new kinds of user interfaces beyond just graphs.

### **Phase 6: Language Model (LM) Integration & Semantic Abstraction**

**Goal:** Integrate advanced Language Model capabilities and move towards purer semantic representations, dissolving conventional HTML paradigms for core UI elements.

1.  **LM-Driven Graph Generation:**
    - Enable dynamic graph creation from natural language descriptions (e.g., "Generate a graph of the US states and their capitals").
    - Allow LMs to infer node types, edge relationships, and initial data properties from unstructured text.
2.  **Intelligent Graph Annotation & Querying:**
    - Integrate LMs for contextual annotation of nodes/edges (e.g., summarizing content, explaining relationships, sentiment analysis).
    - Support natural language querying of graph data (e.g., "Which nodes are connected to 'X' and have a 'status: completed' property?").
3.  **Self-Metaprogramming & Development Assistance:**
    - Explore LM assistance in generating SpaceGraphJS code (e.g., new node types, plugins, layout configurations) from high-level prompts.
    - Leverage LMs for intelligent refactoring suggestions and debugging insights within the SpaceGraphJS codebase.
4.  **Dissolving the HTML Paradigm (Purer Semantic Representations):**
    - Move beyond embedding raw HTML in `HtmlNode`s towards parsing and representing HTML DOM structures as internal sub-graphs.
    - Enable semantic zooming _into_ HTML content, revealing its structural elements as interactive sub-nodes within the 3D space.
    - Develop a declarative API for defining "semantic components" that are rendered natively by SpaceGraphJS's 3D engine, abstracting away underlying HTML/CSS for core UI elements.
    - Explore data-driven UI generation where the spatial interface is dynamically composed directly from the graph's semantic data model.
