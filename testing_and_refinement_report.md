# Testing and Refinement Report - SpaceGraphKT

**Date:** 2023-10-27 (Simulated)
**Test Type:** Manual Code Review & Simulated Execution (Live browser testing was not possible due to environment limitations)

## 1. Summary of Tests Performed (Code Review & Simulation)

The following functionalities were reviewed by stepping through the Kotlin/JS code (`SpaceGraph.kt`, `UIManager.kt`, `CameraController.kt`, `ForceLayout.kt`, `AgentAPI.kt`, Node/Edge classes) and the `agent_example.js` script:

**Core Functionality (Simulated UI Interaction & API Calls):**
*   **Node Management:**
    *   Reviewed `AgentAPI.addNode` and `SpaceGraph.addNode` for creating various node types (`NoteNode`, `ShapeNode`, `HtmlNodeElement`). Data mapping from JS objects to Kotlin `NodeData` and then to specific node constructors was checked.
    *   Reviewed `AgentAPI.removeNode` and `SpaceGraph.removeNode`, including related edge removal and event dispatching (`nodeRemoved`).
    *   Verified that node properties (label, content, style, position) are accessible and theoretically modifiable via `AgentAPI.updateNodeData` and `updateNodePosition`.
*   **Edge Management:**
    *   Reviewed `AgentAPI.addEdge` and `SpaceGraph.addEdge`. Looked at source/target node lookup and `EdgeData` mapping.
    *   Reviewed `AgentAPI.removeEdge` and `SpaceGraph.removeEdge`, including event dispatching (`edgeRemoved`).
    *   Checked `AgentAPI.updateEdgeData` for modifying edge properties.
*   **Node Interaction (UI Simulation):**
    *   `UIManager._onPointerDown/Move/Up`: Reviewed logic for identifying `draggedNode`, `resizedNode`.
    *   `HtmlNodeElement.startResize/resize/endResize` and `BaseNode.startDrag/drag/endDrag`.
    *   `NoteNode` content editability path (though direct DOM interaction for editing is hard to simulate without running).
    *   Node controls (zoom content, grow/shrink) in `HtmlNodeElement` and `UIManager._handleNodeControlButtonClick`.
*   **Camera Control (UI Simulation & API):**
    *   `CameraController` methods: `startPan`, `pan`, `zoom`, `moveTo`. GSAP integration for `moveTo` was noted.
    *   `SpaceGraph.centerView`, `focusOnNode`, `autoZoom` and their calls to `CameraController`.
    *   Agent API equivalents: `agent.focusOnNode`, `agent.centerView`.
*   **Layout (API & Internal):**
    *   `ForceLayout._calculateStep`: High-level review of force calculations.
    *   `AgentAPI.kickLayout` calling `ForceLayout.kick()`.
*   **Selection (UI Simulation & API):**
    *   `UIManager._onPointerDown` logic for selecting nodes/edges.
    *   `SpaceGraph.selectedNode` / `selectedEdge` setters and their role in dispatching `nodeSelected`/`edgeSelected` events via `AgentAPI`.
    *   Agent API: `agent.selectNode`, `agent.selectEdge`, `getSelectedNode`, `getSelectedEdge`.
*   **Context Menus & Dialogs (UI Simulation):**
    *   `UIManager._onContextMenu`, `_getContextMenuItems*`, `_showContextMenu`, `_onContextMenuClick`.
    *   `UIManager._showConfirm` for delete actions.
*   **Edge Menu (UI Simulation):**
    *   `UIManager.showEdgeMenu` on edge selection, `updateEdgeMenuPosition`.

**K2Script Agent API (via `agent_example.js` review):**
*   **Event Subscription:** `agent.onGraphEvent` and `AgentAPI.dispatchGraphEvent` mechanism.
*   **CRUD Operations:** All `add/get/update/remove` Node/Edge calls in `agent_example.js` were reviewed against `AgentAPI` implementations.
*   **Data Retrieval:** `getAllNodes`, `getAllEdges`, `getGraphData`.
*   **Data Loading:** `loadGraphData` and `clearGraph`.
*   **Custom Events:** `dispatchCustomEvent` from agent and its path.
*   **Specific test cases in `agent_example.js`:**
    *   Node/Edge creation, update, removal.
    *   Position updates.
    *   Event reception verification (simulated by checking `eventLogs` logic).
    *   Graph loading.
    *   Focus/selection calls.

**General Stability:**
*   Reviewed `dispose` methods in all relevant classes for resource cleanup.
*   Considered sequence of operations like deleting a selected node.

## 2. Identified Bugs, Errors, or Unexpected Behaviors (from Code Review)

*   **Potential Bug 1: `AgentAPI.addNode` Data Mapping for HTML/Shape specifics.**
    *   **Description:** In `AgentAPI.addNode`, when creating `HtmlNodeElement` or `ShapeNode`, the `nodeData` object is passed. However, specific properties like `width`, `height` for `HtmlNodeElement` or `shapeType`, `shapeSize`, `shapeColor` for `ShapeNode` are taken from `dataConfig` *again* to pass to the constructors, but they are *also* part of the `nodeData` object. This is redundant and could lead to inconsistencies if `nodeData` was meant to be the sole source of truth for the node constructors. The node constructors themselves also try to read from `nodeData.data` (JS) or `nodeData.custom` (Kotlin).
    *   **Location:** `AgentAPI.kt` (`addNode` method).
    *   **Suggested Fix:** Simplify so that `nodeData` is fully populated first, and then node constructors primarily use this `NodeData` object. For example, `HtmlNodeElement` constructor should use `nodeData.width`, not a separately passed `width`. The `AgentAPI` should ensure `nodeData` is correctly formed from the incoming `JsAny? nodeConfig`.
*   **Potential Bug 2: `AgentAPI.updateNodeData` for ShapeNode.**
    *   **Description:** `node.setShape(node.data.shapeType ?: node.shape, node.data.shapeSize ?: node.size)` is called if *either* `shapeType` or `shapeSize` is updated. If only one is provided in `dataToUpdate`, it might incorrectly use the old value for the other parameter from `node.data` which might not yet be updated if `dataToUpdate` is the source of truth for this operation.
    *   **Location:** `AgentAPI.kt` (`updateNodeData` method, `ShapeNode` block).
    *   **Suggested Fix:** Collect all shape-related updates from `dataToUpdate` first, then call `setShape` with potentially mixed new/old values if only one is being changed, or ensure `node.data` is updated before calling `setShape`. A clearer approach would be:
        ```kotlin
        val newShapeType = dataToUpdate.shapeType as? String ?: node.shape
        val newShapeSize = dataToUpdate.shapeSize as? Double ?: node.size
        if (newShapeType != node.shape || newShapeSize != node.size) {
            node.setShape(newShapeType, newShapeSize) // setShape should update node.data internally too
        }
        (dataToUpdate.shapeColor as? Int)?.let { node.setColor(it) }
        ```
*   **Potential Bug 3: `AgentAPI.loadGraphData` Node/Edge Config Reconstruction.**
    *   **Description:** The `loadGraphData` method reconstructs `configForAdd` for nodes and edges. For nodes, it does `this.data = nodeConfig.data`. If `nodeConfig` is the *entire* node structure from `getGraphData` (which includes `id`, `type`, `position`, `data`), then `configForAdd.data` would be `nodeConfig.data.data` effectively, which is likely wrong. The structure from `getGraphData` needs to be carefully deconstructed to match what `addNode`/`addEdge` expect for their `nodeConfig`/`edgeConfig` parameters.
    *   **Location:** `AgentAPI.kt` (`loadGraphData` method).
    *   **Suggested Fix:** `configForAdd` for `addNode` should be the `nodeConfig` itself, or specific fields extracted:
        ```kotlin
        // Inside nodesArray?.forEach for loadGraphData
        val id = nodeConfig.id as? String
        // nodeConfig is already the object that addNode's `nodeConfig` parameter expects (after id is extracted)
        addNode(id, nodeConfig)

        // Similarly for edges:
        val edgeId = edgeConfig.id as? String
        val sourceId = edgeConfig.source as? String ?: ""
        val targetId = edgeConfig.target as? String ?: ""
        // edgeConfig is already what addEdge's `edgeConfig` parameter expects (after ids are extracted)
        addEdge(edgeId, sourceId, targetId, edgeConfig)
        ```
        This assumes `addNode` and `addEdge` in `AgentAPI` are robust enough to handle the `id`, `source`, `target` fields possibly being present on their `nodeConfig`/`edgeConfig` dynamic objects and ignore them if they also take them as separate parameters. Or, clean these from the dynamic object before passing.
*   **Missing Feature/Refinement 1: Event Payload for `nodeDataChanged` / `edgeDataChanged`.**
    *   **Description:** The `changedData` in these events currently sends back the raw `newData` object received by the API. It would be more robust to send back only the fields that *actually* changed and their new values, or at least a consistently structured object. The current approach is okay but less precise.
    *   **Location:** `AgentAPI.kt` (`updateNodeData`, `updateEdgeData`).
*   **Refinement 2: `AgentAPI` Data Conversion Helpers.**
    *   **Description:** The manual `as? Type` casting and `jsObject { ... }` creation is repetitive. Centralized helper functions (perhaps using `kotlinx.serialization` if complexity grows) for `jsToNodeData`, `nodeToJs`, `jsToEdgeData`, `edgeToJs` would make `AgentAPI.kt` cleaner and more maintainable. The current `convertNodeToJs` and `convertEdgeToJs` are good starts but could be more comprehensive or integrated with a serialization approach for parsing inputs too.
    *   **Location:** `AgentAPI.kt`.
*   **Refinement 3: `SpaceGraph.selectedNode/Edge` Setters.**
    *   **Description:** The setters for `selectedNode` and `selectedEdge` in `SpaceGraph.kt` now correctly handle dispatching events. The interaction with `UIManager.show/hideEdgeMenu` is also better. This seems okay now.
    *   **Initial Review Note (now likely resolved by current code):** My initial thought was that UIManager might also try to set styles, leading to redundancy, but the current pattern where UIManager calls `spaceGraph.selectedNode = ...` and the setter handles style changes via `node.setSelectedStyle()` is a good centralized approach.
*   **Refinement 4: Strict Typing for `nodeConfig` and `edgeConfig` in AgentAPI.**
    *   **Description:** While `JsAny?` (dynamic) is flexible for incoming JS objects, creating intermediary Kotlin data classes (not `@JsExport`ed) to represent the expected structure of `nodeConfig` and `edgeConfig` could allow for safer parsing and validation within `AgentAPI` methods before converting to the main `NodeData`/`EdgeData`. This is a step towards `kotlinx.serialization`.
    *   **Location:** `AgentAPI.kt`.
*   **Missing Feature 2: Error Reporting from API.**
    *   **Description:** Most API functions return `Boolean` or `JsAny?` (nullable object). For failures, they log to console but the agent doesn't get a structured error.
    *   **Suggestion:** Consider returning a consistent object like `{ success: boolean, data: object|null, error: string|null }` for more complex operations, or have methods throw exceptions that can be caught in JS (if `@JsExport` allows this smoothly). For now, `null`/`false` is a basic indicator.
*   **Potential Issue: Event Dispatch Timing for `nodeAdded` in `loadGraphData`.**
    *   **Description:** `loadGraphData` calls `addNode` internally. `addNode` dispatches `'nodeAdded'`. If an agent subscribes to `nodeAdded` and then calls `loadGraphData`, it will receive individual events. This is generally fine but could be verbose for large graphs.
    *   **Consideration:** Perhaps a `graphLoadStart` and `graphLoadEnd` event, or a bulk `nodesAdded` event, might be useful for agents if performance with many individual events becomes an issue. For now, individual events are okay.

## 3. Suggestions for API Refinements or Areas Needing Further Work

*   **Data Validation:** Implement more robust validation for data coming into `AgentAPI` from JavaScript to prevent errors and provide clearer feedback to the agent.
*   **Comprehensive Event List:** Review and expand the list of events dispatched by `SpaceGraph` and `UIManager` to cover more interaction details if needed by agents (e.g., `mouseEnterNode`, `mouseLeaveNode`, specific UI interaction events).
*   **Bulk Operations:** For performance with many elements, consider adding bulk versions of API calls (e.g., `addNodes(configs: Array<object>)`, `updateNodesData(updates: Array<object>)`).
*   **Querying:** A more advanced querying API (e.g., `findNodesByProperty(property, value)`) could be beneficial beyond `getAllNodes`.
*   **Styling API:** A more granular API to control node/edge styles beyond what's in `NodeData`/`EdgeData.custom` might be useful (e.g., `agent.setNodeStyle(nodeId, styleObject)`).
*   **`kotlinx.serialization`:** For more robust and less error-prone data conversion between Kotlin and JavaScript, especially for complex nested objects, adopt `kotlinx.serialization.json`. This would involve annotating data classes with `@Serializable`.

## 4. Browser Console Log Output

Live browser testing was not possible in the simulated environment. Therefore, no actual console logs can be provided. The `agent_example.js` includes many `console.log` statements that would show the flow of operations and event reception.

## 5. Updated `agent_example.js`

The `agent_example.js` file was updated with more comprehensive test cases as part of this task execution. The version used for this review is the one generated in the previous step.

## Conclusion

The Kotlin/JS SpaceGraph library and its K2Script Agent API seem relatively robust based on code review and simulated execution. The identified potential bugs are minor and related to data mapping/handling within the API layer or specific update scenarios. The API surface is comprehensive for basic agent interaction. Key areas for future improvement would be more structured data validation/serialization and potentially more granular eventing or bulk operation support if performance with very large graphs/many agent interactions becomes a concern. Live testing is crucial to catch further issues.
